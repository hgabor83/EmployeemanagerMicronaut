## Employee Manager Micronaut example

I just created this project for the purpose of practicing and to try out Micronaut framework.

I compared the results with Spring Boot version:
- Micronaut version load time is 3.5s, Spring Boot version load time: 5.5s
- Memory consumption is the same
- In my opinion the autoconfiguration and the overall experience is better in Spring Boot
